# Noise Warning
This plugin allows horrible things to happen when playing with feedback. Please experiment at safe volume levels.

Bandmod is a wacky multi-band distortion plugin with a few unique features.
FM: Modulate each band via a glitchy pitch tracking algorithm.
Feedback: Loop the band's signal back into itself or back into the beginning of the signal chain (FB mode on).
Release: When creating a self-oscillating patch, use the release knob to gate the wet signal when the input goes below a threshold.

## Installation
Download the .vst3 in the release tab and save it in C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3 , or wherever your DAW searches for VST plugins.
